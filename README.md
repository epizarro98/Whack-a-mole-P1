## Concept:

The objective of this game is to get as many whack on the moles as possible! 
With the attempt of placing a higher score than the next person, or simply trying to beat your own high score.
You have 30 seconds to try and whack as many moles as you can, while the moles are going at a rapid pace.

#### User stories

As a user i expect to see the moles pop in a hole into another like the real whack-a-mole game at an arcade, somewhat.
Also, to track how many times I whacked the moles to get a high score.

#### Development Plan 

* Get gameboard issued
* Make moles appear
* Add a conditional to see who has the highest score
* Style my game

#### MVP

* Display gameboard
* Make moles appear
* Handle gameover condition/scoring
* Style the game

#### Stretch goals

* Play a noise each time a mole is whacked
* Add a hammer as the cursor

## Challenges:

I had some challenges were making the modal pop up and styling the entire game in general. Handling the gameover condition and score-tracking was also a challenge.
